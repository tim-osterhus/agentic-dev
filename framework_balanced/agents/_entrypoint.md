# Entrypoint
## Purpose
Kickoff brief for Prompt Engineer, Builder, and QA in the balanced flow. Connects task intake with prompt refinement, autoscheduling, and push expectations.

## Quickstart
1) Read `workflow/outline.md`, `workflow/roadmap.md`, and the active card in `workflow/tasks.md`. Pull new work from `workflow/tasks_backlog.md` using `workflow/autoscheduler.md` when capacity allows.  
2) For any new task, run `agents/prompt_engineering_cycle.md` before `agents/builder_cycle.md`.  
3) Align on quality bars in `workflow/expectations.md` and note recent context in `workflow/historylog.md`.  
4) Choose the right specialization from `agents/roles/*.md` (Builder) or plan validation via `agents/qa_cycle.md` (QA).

## Session Setup
- Record owner, branch, and tooling assumptions.  
- Note risk areas or forbidden changes.  
- Decide when to trigger `workflow/github_push_cycle.md` after QA approval.  
- Log open questions or scope risks in `workflow/historylog.md` before editing.
