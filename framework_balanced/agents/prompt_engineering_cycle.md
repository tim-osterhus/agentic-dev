# Prompt Engineering Cycle

## Purpose
Refine task instructions before the Builder acts to reduce ambiguity and rework.

## Intended Sequence in the Workflow
Runs before builder_cycle.md on each task, pulling context from tasks.md, expectations.md, and recent historylog.md entries.

- TODO: Define steps to adjust system/task prompts per task.
- TODO: Capture key clarifications and share back to Builder and QA.
- TODO: Add guardrails for avoiding scope creep during refinement.
