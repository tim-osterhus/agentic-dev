# Role: Backend
## Purpose
Backend specialization with attention to prompt intent and reproducible changes.

## When to activate
- API/service logic changes, schema updates, or integrations.

## Checklist
- Confirm prompt clarifications and acceptance criteria before changing services or schemas.  
- Keep migrations explicit; document rollout/rollback steps in `workflow/historylog.md`.  
- Run targeted backend tests; log commands and results.  
- Escalate scope creep to the Prompt Engineer or task owner before expanding scope.
