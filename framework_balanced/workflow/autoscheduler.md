## Purpose
Lightweight scheduler that pulls tasks from tasks_backlog.md and activates them in tasks.md.

## Intended Sequence in the Workflow
Runs after QA or on a cadence to keep the pipeline full. Coordinates with prompt_engineering_cycle.md before Builder starts.

- TODO: Define prioritization rules and eligibility checks.
- TODO: Describe how to assign owners and notify agents.
- TODO: Note safeguards to avoid overloading the session.
