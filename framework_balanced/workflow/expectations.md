# Expectations
## Purpose
Quality bar and constraints for the balanced flow. Aligns prompt refinement, Builder, QA, and push decisions.

## How to use
- QA: author/update this before running validation.  
- Builder and Prompt Engineer: read for awareness but do not edit during a task.  
- Update if scope changes; record revisions in `workflow/historylog.md`.

## Template
- Functional expectations and boundaries: …  
- Non-functional items (performance, safety, logging): …  
- Tests/commands required before QA and before push: …  
- Review/acceptance gates and escalation paths: …  
- Items explicitly out of scope: …
