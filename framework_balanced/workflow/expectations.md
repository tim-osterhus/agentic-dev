# Expectations
## Purpose
Quality bar and constraints for the balanced flow. Aligns prompt refinement, Builder, QA, and push decisions.

## How to use
- Prompt Engineer: codify expectations before Builder starts.  
- Builder: plan and execute within these boundaries.  
- QA: validate against this list and note any deviations in `workflow/historylog.md`.  
- Update if scope changes; record revisions.

## Template
- Functional expectations and boundaries: …  
- Non-functional items (performance, safety, logging): …  
- Tests/commands required before QA and before push: …  
- Review/acceptance gates and escalation paths: …  
- Items explicitly out of scope: …
