# Tasks Backlog
## Purpose
Intake queue feeding the autoscheduler. Keep items concise and ready for prompt refinement.

## How to use
- Keep highest-priority ready items at the top; note dependencies and blockers.  
- When capacity frees up, use `workflow/autoscheduler.md` to move one item into `workflow/tasks.md`.  
- If an item is unclear, add questions here and pause scheduling until clarified.
