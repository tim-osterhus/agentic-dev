# Entrypoint

## Purpose
Primary instructions for orchestrating multiple agents and sessions. Sets global scope, constraints, and resource limits before work begins.

## How it interacts with other files
Feeds roles guidance to specific agents, points Builders to builder_cycle.md, and instructs QA teams to follow qa_cycle.md or deep_qa_cycle.md depending on risk.

- TODO: List session bootstrapping steps and environment notes.
- TODO: Define escalation paths to orchestrator.md.
- TODO: Capture shared constraints for all concurrent agents.
