# QA Cycle

## Purpose
Baseline QA loop for routine tasks, ensuring coverage without blocking throughput.

## How it interacts with other files
Pulls acceptance criteria from expectations.md, logs results to historylog.md, and escalates high-risk items to deep_qa_cycle.md.

- TODO: Specify tests to run before approvals.
- TODO: Define approval thresholds and retry rules.
- TODO: Note when to defer to deep_qa_cycle.md.
