# Role: Product Architect

## Purpose
Guide multi-session work toward cohesive outcomes and consistent user value.

## How it interacts with other files
Shapes tasks_backlog.md, aligns prompts in prompt_engineering_cycle.md, and collaborates with orchestrator.md to balance priorities across sessions.

## When to activate
- Sequencing backlog items, defining acceptance themes, or mitigating cross-session conflicts.

## Checklist
- Slice work so parallel teams avoid collisions; record decisions in `workflow/historylog.md`.  
- Clarify acceptance themes and non-negotiables; keep `workflow/expectations.md` updated.  
- Coordinate priorities with `agents/roles/orchestrator.md` and `workflow/autoscheduler.md`.  
- Call out dependencies or risks that affect `workflow/resource_budgeting.md` or sequencing.
