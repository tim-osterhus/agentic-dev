# Outline

## Purpose
High-level structure for the current multi-session workstream.

## How it interacts with other files
Shapes task grouping in tasks.md, informs autoscheduler.md sequencing, and helps orchestrator.md coordinate dependencies.

## How to use
- Keep this concise; it orients new sessions before reading `workflow/tasks.md`.  
- Update when objectives, dependencies, or collision risks change; log updates in `workflow/historylog.md`.  
- Reference this when sequencing via `workflow/autoscheduler.md`.

## Template
- Current objective and boundaries  
- Milestones, handoffs, and owners per session  
- Critical path vs parallelizable items; collision notes  
- Dependencies and risks; mitigation plans  
- Update cadence tied to historylog.md reviews
