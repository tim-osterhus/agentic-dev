# Roadmap

## Purpose
Forward-looking plan for scaling throughput and coverage over time.

## How it interacts with other files
Feeds tasks_backlog.md with future items, aligns with resource_budgeting.md for capacity planning, and informs session_registry.md sizing.

## How to use
- Use this to set priorities and capacity assumptions before autoscheduling.  
- Call out dependencies and resource implications so `workflow/resource_budgeting.md` can be updated.  
- Revisit on a cadence set by `agents/roles/orchestrator.md`; log revisions in `workflow/historylog.md`.

## Template
- Near-term initiatives ready to schedule  
- Mid-term items needing design or resource decisions  
- Long-term bets and capacity plans  
- Dependencies, risks, and resource implications  
- Review cadence and owners
