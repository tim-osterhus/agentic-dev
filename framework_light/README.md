# framework_light

Minimal Builder + QA loop with the fewest moving parts. Single-task-at-a-time, single-session focus. Prioritizes simplicity, low overhead, and clear markdown handoffs.

Start at `agents/_entrypoint.md`, then follow `agents/builder_cycle.md` or `agents/qa_cycle.md`. Roles live under `agents/roles/`. Active work is tracked in `workflow/tasks.md` with backlog, expectations, outline, roadmap, and history in `workflow/`.
