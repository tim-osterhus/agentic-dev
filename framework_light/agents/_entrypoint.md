# Entrypoint

## Purpose
Starting brief for a single-session, single-task run. Aligns on scope, guardrails, and which files to open next before any work begins.

## Quickstart
1) Open `workflow/outline.md` and `workflow/roadmap.md` to ground yourself in current priorities.  
2) Read the active card in `workflow/tasks.md` (ignore `workflow/tasks_backlog.md` unless scheduling).  
3) Check `workflow/expectations.md` for quality bars, constraints, and forbidden areas.  
4) Choose the right specialization from `agents/roles/*.md`.  
5) If you are executing, follow `agents/builder_cycle.md`. If you are validating, follow `agents/qa_cycle.md`.

## Logging and handoff
- Record questions, decisions, commands, and blockers in `workflow/historylog.md` as you go.  
- Keep diffs small and focused on the active task.  
- Stop and document if scope is unclear; do not proceed on guesses.
