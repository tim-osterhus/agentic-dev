# Builder Cycle
Lean loop for executing one task at a time. Emphasize clarity, small diffs, and explicit handoff notes for QA.

- TODO: Intake task, restate scope, and risks.
- TODO: Plan steps and checkpoints before coding.
- TODO: Execute with frequent notes in historylog.md.
- TODO: Prepare QA handoff with test commands and expected outcomes.
