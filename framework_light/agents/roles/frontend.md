# Role: Frontend
## Purpose
Specialization for UI/client flows. Prioritize clarity, accessibility, and quick validation.

## When to activate
- Client feature work, UX adjustments, or integration of new endpoints.

## Checklist
- Align with design intent; avoid silent changes to interaction patterns.  
- Keep components small and reversible; prefer incremental UI updates.  
- Run lint/build and fast UI checks; capture screenshots or notes if manual validation is needed.  
- Record visual or accessibility gaps and device/browser assumptions in `workflow/historylog.md`.
