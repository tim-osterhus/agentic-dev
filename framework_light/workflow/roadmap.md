# Roadmap
## Purpose
Forward-looking view beyond the current task. Helps stage upcoming work and staffing.

## How to use
- Keep this brief; use it to inform `workflow/tasks_backlog.md` and expectations.  
- Note dependencies and sequencing so autoscheduling (if used) stays safe.  
- Update after major decisions; record changes in `workflow/historylog.md`.

## Template
- Near-term items (ready soon): …  
- Mid-term items (need design/decisions): …  
- Long-term ideas (parked): …  
- Review cadence and owners: …
